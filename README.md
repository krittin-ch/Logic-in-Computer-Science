# Logic in Computer Science

## Overview
This repository is based on *Logic in Computer Science: Modelling and Reasoning about Systems* by **Michael Huth** and **Mark Ryan**. The book encompasses **six main chapters**:

1. Propositional Logic
2. Predicate Logic
3. Verification by Model Checking
4. Program Verification
5. Modal Logics and Agents
6. Binary Decision Diagrams

However, this repository focuses on the practical implementations of the following two chapters:

Chapter 2: Predicate Logic
-This section leverages Alloy, a tool for modeling and analysis, to implement predicate logic. Alloy's advantages allow us t0 study intricate systems and create instances for examination and study of logical restrictions and properties.

Chapter 3: Verification by Model Checking
-This section utilizes NuSMV, a tool for model checking, particularly in Linear Temporal Logic (LTL). NuSMV is an excellent tool for enabling system behaviors, detecting faults during the design phase, and evaluating finite state systems against temporal logic specifications.
